## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week One!

Welcome to week one of Earth Analytics! In week 1 we will explore data together
in class related to the 2013 Colorado Floods. In your homework, you will set up
`Python` and `Jupyter Notebook` on your laptop and learn how to create an Jupyter Notebook
document and convert it to an .html.

### 1. Readings

### 2. Watch flood video
First, watch this video to learn more about the 2013 Colorado floods and some
of the data that can be used to better understand the drivers and impacts of those
floods.

### 3. Review open science slide show
Note: these were also linked in the lessons below.

View Slideshow: Share, Publish & Archive Code & Data</a>

### 4. Review lessons
The second part of your homework assignment is to review the homework lessons (see links
on the left hand side of this page).
Following the lessons, setup `Python`, `Jupyter Notebook` and a
`working directory` that will contain the data we will use for week one and the
rest of the semester on your laptop.

Once everything is setup, complete the second set of lessons which walk you
through creating R markdown documents and knitting them to `.html` format. If you
already are familiar with `Jupyter Notebooks`, be sure to review the lessons anyway - particularly
the ones about file organization and why we use this workflow in science.

<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Important:** Review
ALL of the lessons and have your computer setup BEFORE class begins next week.
You will be behind if these things are not setup / complete before week 2.

### 5. Complete assignment below

After you have reviewed the lessons above, complete the assignment below.
Submit your `.html` document and `.ipynb` document to the D2L course drop box
by **Wed 25 January 2017 at NOON Mountain Time.**

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework Submission: Create A Report Using Jupyter Notebooks

* Create a new notebook `.ipynb` file in `Jupyter Notebook`. Name the file:
`yourLastName-firstInitial-week1.ipynb` example: `wasser-l-week1.ipynb`

* Add an author in a cell of markdown at the top of the document
* Give your file an appropriate title. Suggestion: `Earth Analytics Spring 2017: Homework - Week 1`
* At the top of the notebook make a markdown cell and add some text
that describes:

   * What an `.ipynb` file is
   * Why using `Jupyter Notebooks` to create reports can be helpful to both you and your colleagues that you work with on a project.

* Create a new CODE CHUNK
* Copy and paste the code BELOW into the code chunk that you just created.
* Below the code chunk in your document, add some TEXT that describes what the plot that you created
shows - interpret what you see in the data.
* Finally, in your own words, summarize what you think the plot shows / tells us about
the flood and also how the data that produced the plot were likely collected. Use the video
about the Boulder Floods as a reference when you write this summery.

BONUS: If you know `python`, clean up the plot by adding labels and a title.

```python

# import libraries
import urllib.request
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# download data from figshare
# note that you are downloading the data into your data directory
url = 'https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7010681'
destfile = "data/boulder-precip.csv"
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, destfile)

# import data to a pandas dataframe
boulder_precip = pd.read_csv(destfile)

# view the first few rows of data
display(boulder_precip.head())

# view each column of the data frame using it's name/header
display(boulder_precip['DATE'])
display(boulder_precip['PRECIP'])

# create plot using matplotlib
plt.plot('DATE','PRECIP',data=boulder_precip)

# rotate x tick labels to be legible
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

# draw plot
plt.show()

```

Your Jupyter Notebook should look something like the one above (with your own text
added to it). Note that the image above is CROPPED at the bottom. Your Jupyter Notebook
file will have more code in it.

### Troubleshooting: missing plot

If the code above did not produce a plot, please check the following:

#### Check your working directory

If the path to your file is not correct, then the data won't load into `python`.
If the data don't load into `python`, then you can't work with it or plot it.

To figure out your current working directory use the command: `os.getcwd()`
    
Next, go to your finder or file explorer on your computer. Navigate to the path
that `python` gives you when you type `` in the console. It will look something
like the path example: `/Users/your-username/documents/earth-analytics`

```python 

# check your working directory
import os
os.getcwd()

## [1] "/Users/lewa8222/documents/earth-analytics"
```

In the example above, note that my USER directory is called `lewa8222`. Yours
is called something different. Is there a `data` directory within the earth-analytics
directory?

</a>
<figcaption>
Your working directory should contain a `/data` directory.

</figure>

If not, review the [working directory lesson](/courses/earth-analytics-python/get-started-with-python-jupyter/introduction-to-bash-shell/)
to ensure your working directory is SETUP properly.
